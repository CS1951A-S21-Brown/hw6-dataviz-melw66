                The first graph shows the top 10 video games of all time, where they were ranked based on global sales. It clearly shows the top 10 games 
                ordered in descending order of sales. A horizontal bar chart works because the sales values could be displayed next to the bars, and the 
                relative sales numbers can be easily compared. The second graph is a pie chart that can be toggled to be for a different region. A pie chart 
                works because all the genres that make up sales are being shown, so comparing percentages makes sense. The slices are ordered in descending 
                order of size, so the viewer can easily see which genre had the most sales. The third graph is a vertical bar chart showing only the top 15
                publishers (based on global sales) for the selected genre (can be toggled). A bar chart works here because the relative heights of the bars 
                clearly shows the relationships between the top 15 publishers for the genre, with the number one top publisher clearly being the first bar,
                since bars are order in descending order of sales.

                D3 was very helpful because it makes creating SVGs, which are scalable without losing image quality, very easy for common data visualizations.
                D3's the animation/transitions are also very easy to use, which makes visualizations transition smoothly between each other, allowing the viewer 
                to have some sense of how the data is different before and after the change. D3 also essentially makes you build a lot of things up from scratch,
                which allows for a lot of freedom and room for customization.

                D3 is very useful for creating beautiful, interactive visualizations, however it can be very time-consuming when compared to using other tools 
                like Matplotlib or Excel for non-interative ones. So when visualizations are non-interactive and need to be made quickly, D3 would not be the 
                best tool. D3 may also not be the best when there is an extremely large amount of data points being visualized in the browser, since having such 
                a large amount of SVG elements will show things down by a lot. D3 may also make it tempting to use unnecessarily complicated data visualizations 
                when a simple bar or scatter plot will communicate things most effectively to the intended audience. When visualizations should be simple, other 
                libraries are much easier and quicker to use and get the same results.

                Users with visual and motor impairments may find the dashboard harder to use, while users without those impairments would find it accessible.
                In the article by Amanda Miller, it is mentioned that hover overlays should be avoided when possible since assistive technologies most likely cannot
                make use of them. The visually impaired would be unable to use the hover overlays, and the motor impaired would have a hard time trying to use them
                as well. So for the pie chart, I would consider removing the hover option and having the information put outside the pie chart with lines going into 
                the slices to indicate correspondence. This would also make the legend able to be removed, thus removing the reliance on color, which Miller also 
                recommends. The slices' information can also have a ranking of relative size (for example 1 for largest slice and larger numbers for smaller slices).
                This would help the visually impaired. The article by Doug Schepers also mentions how important alt text is and how alt text that summarizes the data
                would help the visually impaired a lot and save their time. Therefore I would add alt text given the time. Lastly, a keyboard accessible zoom feature 
                could be added (enlarges a simgle graph) for those who are slightly visually impaired and can't read the small font sizes.

                The biggest factor that kept me from taking the steps mentioned in the previous question was lack of time and large learning curve for D3 in general.
                While this answer doesn't seem that great, it definitely shows the problem with how accessibility is viewed. Accessibility is often seen as something to 
                be built later upon something that is already "completed". The large learning curve and amount of time spent using D3 sacrifices time for customizability,
                which here translated to lack of accessibility.
